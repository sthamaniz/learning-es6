list of learning es6

1. new variables let and const 
   #let - cannot be redeclared using let keyword but can be redeclared without using let keyword
   #const - cannot be redeclared (neither using nor not using the keyword)
   
2. arrow function 
   #using fat arrow as the function without using the keyword function
    
   #multiline function with return
   let testfunction = (can pass the variable to the function) => {
     this is the body of the function;
     return the value of the function;
   };
    
   #single line function without return
   let testfunction = (can pass the variable to the function) => return the value without the return keyword;
    
3. template literals
   #using template literals instead of quotes to make the multiple line of code inside the template literals work which does not work inside the quotes

4. spread operators
   #used to spread and join the array
   #also used to pass the array in the function 
   
5. class and inheritance of the class
   #used to define a class
   #used to inherit the properties of the superclass and its contents to child class
  
6. generators
   # used to pause the function with the yield keyword and run the another line after yield keyword with the next keyword.
   function* sampleGenerator(){
      do this;
      yield that;
      do another this;
      yield another that;
   }
   
   #run the function till the yield keyword
   let sample = sampleGenerator();
   sample.next();
 
7. for function
   #used to loop through the array result
   newArray = [];
   for (arrays of array){
      console.log(array);
      #push into new array
      newArray.push(array);
   }
   
   #forEach can also be used
   arrays.forEach((array) => {
      console.log(array);
      #for assiciated array
      console.log(array.name);
   });
   
 
8. filter function
   #used to filter the arrays according to the need
   arrays = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
   let filteredArray = arrays.filter(array => array > 5);
   console.log(filterArrays)
    
   #result 
   filterArray = [6,7];
    
 9. map function 
    #used to loop through each element of the array and perfome some action
    let arrays = array.map(arr => arr * 2);
    #multiplies each element of the array by 2
